JS is 
*single threaded
*Synchronous
*High level Programming Language


1.Single threaded.
*threaded is nothing but a part of processer
*A Programming Language which excute or send single instruction at a time that is called single threaded 
//A Programming Language which excute or send multiple instruction at a time that is called Multi- threaded(Ex. Java, Python, c#)
*Js can run faster than any other multi threaded Language

2.Synchronous/ ASynchronous

(i)Synchronous
*It excutes the code line by line it will not jump to next statement without the excution of before statement
Example:-

Input:-
console.log("HELLO WORLD")
console.log("HELLO WORLD 1")
console.log("HELLO WORLD 2")

Output:-
HELLO WORLD
HELLO WORLD 1
HELLO WORLD 2

(ii)ASynchronous

*It can excute the code when you need to excute a code it can skip the statements.
Example:-(Using Node Js server)
Input:-

console.log("Hello World) // statement 1 
const http = require("http");

http.createServer((req, res) => {
    //we are ending response  and returning it to client
    res.end(" IS PERMENENT",);
    console.log("Nothing") // statement 2
}).listen(5882);

console.log(" World") // statement 3


Output:-
In the above code

statement 1 and 3 will be running first on node js terminal
statement 2 will excute only when you csll the local host 5228
// Just excute and the code and you will understand

****Js is by default a Synchronous Programing Language******(but we can change them to ASynchronous)



3.High level Programming / Low level Programming Languages

(i)Low Level:-
binary numbers zeors and ones - Not easy to or not understandable by Human

(ii)High Level:-
easy for human to understand - Js, Python  etc


*Server side only understand Low Level Language that is binary digitis zeros and ones
*Node Js is compiler and interptor for Js which converts High level Language to Low level Language

What is a Function?
A Block of codes to perform a task

Why do we use it?
* Reusability
* Modularity
*Teastability

How to Use it?

Function addTwoNumber(){
    ....
}

() ---> to take input into functions
(x,y) ---> Parameter/ Argument is the input
{}---> defines the body of the function

return - return is used to return output to caller.

How to call a function?
Starts with name of the function and store it in a variable.
to print the results console.log the var.
